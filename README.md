Epidemiology
GPH-GU 2106, Section 013
FALL 2024
COURSE DESCRIPTION
Epidemiology is the study of the distribution and determinants of health and disease in different human populations and the application of methods to improve disease outcomes. As such, epidemiology is the basic science of public health. This course is designed to introduce students in all fields of public health to the background, basic principles and methods of public health epidemiology. Topics covered in this course include: basic principles of epidemiology; measures of disease frequency; epidemiologic study designs: experimental and observational; bias; confounding; outbreak investigations; screening; causality; and ethical issues in epidemiologic research. In addition, students will develop skills to read, interpret and evaluate health information from published epidemiologic studies.
COURSE FORMAT
This in-person, three (3) credit course consists of two main components: a lecture and a discussion section. In total, students will receive 2,250 minutes of live in-person instruction and discussion with a recitation instructor. Attending both lecture and discussion sections are equally important to ensuring success in the course. All students are required to attend lecture and discussion sections.
COURSE OVERVIEW
Lectures will follow a didactic format that will provide students with information and explanation about the importance of the fundamental concepts of epidemiology as they apply to measuring and understanding population-level health. Lectures will focus on introducing the topics outlined in the course schedule and for providing examples of how these concepts are measured via the application of epidemiologic study designs.
The overarching goal of the discussion sessions is to enhance familiarity and confidence in the concepts covered in the lectures. In order to meet this goal, students will work in small groups on case studies and exercises developed to provide connections between concepts covered in lectures and real-world examples scenarios. In addition, these weekly sessions provide another opportunity for students to clarify any concepts presented in the online lecture materials, as well as review prior and/or upcoming homework assignments.
PRE-REQUISITES
There are no formal pre-requisite courses for this class.
However, success in this course requires an understanding of basic arithmetic and algebraic concepts and ability to apply these concepts. Specifically, students should feel comfortable working with fractions, decimals, multi-step arithmetic problems and extract numerical information described in text and graphical formats. For further guidance or support, please refer to the information and resources provided in the Foundations for Epidemiology and Biostatistics primer (GPH-GU 5010).

I reserve the right to add readings during the course of the semester as appropriate.
Additional resources:
1. If you would like to purchase or borrow another textbook from the library, we recommend:
a. Gordis L. Epidemiology. 6th Edition (2019).
Additional textbooks based on content area, level of expertise, etc. as well several websites, and articles are also available. For specific areas of interest, please let me know, and I can provide additional resources.
B. REQUIREMENTS  EXPECTATIONS
1. Students are expected to attend all lecture sessions. Students are expected to come to class on time to prevent disrupting the lecture and classroom activities.
2. Attend discussion sections:
- Discussion sessions are held on a weekly basis and led by discussion section instructors noted above. Only attend the discussion section you are enrolled in and do not attend another discussion for which you are not registered.
- Active participation in the discussion sessions is also expected and highly encouraged.
- Attendance is mandatory. If you cannot attend a given session, it is your responsibility to notify your discussion section instructor beforehand, or in case of an emergency, immediately upon return. All other absences from the discussion section will be considered unexcused.
- Any student who has more than 2 unexcused absences from the scheduled discussion section meetings will lose points from their discussion section grade.
3. Technology Policy for lecture sessions:
- Mobile device ringers will be turned off or placed on vibrate before class.
- Laptops and tablets can ONLY be used in the classroom to take notes, make calculations, and download/read course materials. There are studies that indicate that non-academic use of the Internet is associated with poorer learning outcomes. PLUS, it really does distract your fellow classmates seated near you!
4. Complete reading assignments prior to class. Readings are listed in the course schedule and additional readings may be assigned as needed.
5. Complete homework assignments (6): Homework assignments are due on the dates noted below. They will be posted to BrightSpace. Late homework will not be accepted. You can rely on your class notes or other supplemental materials to complete your assignment, but it is an individual effort so do not share answers with others!
